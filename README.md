# Spacegadi

A C project based on the Mobile Game 2 Cars built for the 1st Semester Project Display.
The project has graphics.h header file using Borland Graphics Interface thus might work only under Turbo C++. 
It is the derived version of original project reconfigured for the easier usage.

# Usage:
Not a Time Based but a kbhit based movement of the Cars ie. jumping from particular cordinates to other after pressing a specified Key but only left or right direction. The Obstacles will flow to bottom continuously but not in random fashion ie. will reapt it's pattern.
